## About The App

The bot is built using [slack.dev/bolt-js](https://github.com/slackapi/bolt-js) and has slash commands to execute functions.
- /charlie "<message to be sent"> : This command opens a conversation in slack workspace and sends the message you want to send of any length to all the members in the workspace.
This functionality is not available in official app, instead sending proffessional DMs is impossible while it creates a group of members you try to send message to.
The slash commands solves this hindrance.

- /charlie "<message>" @user1 @user2...: The above command does send message to each and everyone in the workspace but if any user need to be excluded you mention them using @-(slack mentioning convention).

Charlie bot will come up with more slash commands and functionalities very much helpful for eveyday slack users.

## Technologies

The tech used are:

- [Boltjs](https://github.com/slackapi/bolt-js)

## Setup

- download or clone the repository
- run `npm install`
- cd SlackBot_Charlie
- nodemon index.js

## Approach

- Initially started with a slash command of greeting the user on opening the home tab of bot.
- to implement individual DMs the message conversation needs to be opened and then the message sent, documentation of slack.dev provides for methods to facilitate this.
- The local server providing backend runs on socket mode with slack [untill the app is deployed on backend server]

## Status
- Yet to be deployed on production workspace.

## Upcoming features
- /delete This will delete all the conversations in that particular channel/private conversation channel
- /weather This will pick up current location of user and using weather api will fetch the weather data of that place.
- Implementing sent and read status of messages sent to a user whether in channel or DM
